      <description>Difference between concurrency and parallelism does not resonate with most people, including me, for a while now. Until i started learning Go and everything became clear. Particularly with this one concise explaination that has stuck with me:
 Concurrency is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently. Parallelism is about running those pieces simultaneously. Concurrency is about structure; parallelism is about execution.</description>
