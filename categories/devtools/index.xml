      <description>I am excited to announce the launch of koncart, an idea turned startup(ish) that i have been working on for the last one year plus. Koncart is a toolset company that empowers fintech ideas with Devtools and Analytics dashboards. It is currently in private beta.
The original idea was to build ECommerce Enabling APIs, which was conceptualized with my close friend and colleague in code John Adams and i. Fast Forward, i took the idea further after working with a few Fintech products and Startups and discovering some of the abstractions that needed a standalone platform.</description>
