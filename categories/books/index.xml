      <description>To the reader of this book and the curious a like thank you for checking out this book.
Truthfully, this is was a random thought that crossed my mind. Having read some of the photography books, i thought i could write one too. I gathered some of the best photos i have taken and decided to do storytelling with them. Hopefully this is the first of many to come.
This is a self-published book and freely available for download.</description>
