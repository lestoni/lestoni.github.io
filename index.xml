      <description>At one point, in your backend you will have a case where you need to update a bulk of data, due one reason or another.
In this case, i am going to focus on bulk documents updating in mongodb.
Setup Start off your mongodb shell:
$ mongod some_db Create a javascript file called bulk_write.js and add the following code . We will use this to in insert 10000 documents of receipts type document into the db.</description>

I am a software engineer primarily specializing in designing and building of RESTFul API&amp;rsquo;s aka programming for the internets.

      <title>Introducing Koncart</title>

      <description>I am excited to announce the launch of koncart, an idea turned startup(ish) that i have been working on for the last one year plus. Koncart is a toolset company that empowers fintech ideas with Devtools and Analytics dashboards. It is currently in private beta.
The original idea was to build ECommerce Enabling APIs, which was conceptualized with my close friend and colleague in code John Adams and i. Fast Forward, i took the idea further after working with a few Fintech products and Startups and discovering some of the abstractions that needed a standalone platform.</description>

      <description>To the reader of this book and the curious a like thank you for checking out this book.
Truthfully, this is was a random thought that crossed my mind. Having read some of the photography books, i thought i could write one too. I gathered some of the best photos i have taken and decided to do storytelling with them. Hopefully this is the first of many to come.
This is a self-published book and freely available for download.</description>

      <description>Difference between concurrency and parallelism does not resonate with most people, including me, for a while now. Until i started learning Go and everything became clear. Particularly with this one concise explaination that has stuck with me:
 Concurrency is a way to structure a program by breaking it into pieces that can be executed independently. Parallelism is about running those pieces simultaneously. Concurrency is about structure; parallelism is about execution.</description>
