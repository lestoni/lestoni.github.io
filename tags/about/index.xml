      <description>Hello there, i appreciate you stopping by, my name is Tony Mutai or lestoni if you prefer. I live in Nairobi, Kenya.
I am a software engineer primarily specializing in designing and building of RESTFul API&amp;rsquo;s aka programming for the internets. The love for working with APIâ€™s stems from interest and enjoyment of working with web scale distributed and concurrent systems. I mostly code with NodeJS, Golang but i am working towards being a polyglot.</description>
